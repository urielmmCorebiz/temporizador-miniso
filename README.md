# Corebiz Sandbox

## Use this app to make tests with vtexio. 

This app is allowed to use the following builders:

- assets
- styles
- store
- react
- node
- graphql
- messages

Download the repository [here](https://bitbucket.org/corebiz_ag/io-sandbox/downloads/) or create a branch to do the tests. The master branch is just a boilerplate, only commit to the master branch if it's a bug fix or improviment that can help everyone.

It's is not necessary to use all the builders, if you only need node you can delete the others builders in your branch.
